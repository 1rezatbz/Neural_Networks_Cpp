# Building Neural Networks with C++

This software is a neural network implementation using C++ to provide a deeper understanding of neural network structure and training processes.

## Description

The project's main features include:

* A fully-functional neural network written in C++.
* Training and testing datasets for classification and regression problems.
* Visualization of training progress and results.

## Getting Started

Here are the steps to get started with this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run `cmake .` to generate the Makefile.
4. Run `make` to compile the code.
5. Run the executable file to start using the neural network.

## Prerequisites

To use this project, you will need the following:

* C++ compiler (e.g. g++ or clang++)
* CMake

## Usage

Once you have compiled the code and generated the executable file, you can use the neural network to train and test your data. Refer to the documentation for more details.
